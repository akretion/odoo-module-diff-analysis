[CHG] *: make binary fields default to attachment=True

Check that it makes custom binary fields into attachment as that's the
main reason for the change: when users create binary fields via Studio,
they're necessarily db-stored (as the interface doesn't allow altering
the attachment attribute and it's unclear how we'd handle users
switching it on/off every time), which significantly bloats their
database (and burns storage & backup space), especially as the primary
use case for binary fields is adding images and documents to records.

* check that binary fields are properly created as attachment=True
* add attachment=False on fields where that seems relevant (most but not
  all of the fields previously using the default)
* remove occurrences of attachment=True
