[ADD/MOV] sale_product_configurator: new module and files move

Purpose
=======
- Moved the product_configurator into its own module now that we have a specific option for it.
  The option only enables the p. configurator in the SO form.
  The e-commerce should always allow customer to configure their products, even if the option is not checked.

  This allows moving some of the code specific to the p. configurator into its own module.
  However, a lot of the code has to remain in "sale" module since the e-commerce does not require the option
  checked and needs the "configure product" feature in the shop by default.
  (This is why the fields "product_custom_attribute_value_ids" and "product_no_variant_attribute_value_ids"
  are still in the "sale" module)
