[REF] *: Analytic Apocalypse

The goal of this commit is to get rid of the analytic tags as they were confusing, serving tag purposes as well as distribution on analytic accounts.

Everywhere analytic tags were used as a distribution have been replaced with a new widget that will dispatch distribution on analytic accounts. If there was an analytic account field next to the tags, it has been included in the distribution.

Analytic tags that were used simply as information tags have been removed.

To fill the new widget, there are now 2 kind of rules that will help fill and prefill it.
The first are applicability: previous groups have been removed, and have by replaced by plans. Each account is required to have a plan. These plans define when they are available in the widget: a default applicability per plan and applicability lines that can specify rules following the context of the widget.

The second one are distribution models, that will replace previous default rules but follow the same principles. The accounts (and so the plans) that will be given by the distribution model can override the applicability rules from before.
