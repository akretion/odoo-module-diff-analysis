[IMP] web,account,...: Regroup settings, add a nav and search bar

Purpose
=======

Settings are often way too long and hard to scan and sometimes you don't know where to find the settings you're looking for.
By adding a left navigation, you can already have an overview of the settings, and switch easily between them.

Specification
=============

- Add a search bar on all the apps that have settings which can search results from all the installed apps.
  (If i'm on sales settings,and I search anything then it shows results from sales settings and also shows
  all the other matching results from all the other apps such as, Inventory...etc) with app name.
- Able to activate feature from the current page results (no matter if the searched result is from another apps).
- Highlight searched word in results
- Delete the sheet, have a full white background
- Add left navigation bar on setting
- Left navigation bar fixed
- List displayed based on installed apps
- On right panel, by default display current app setting and change accordingly
- [Mobile] Left navigation bar displayed on top
- Add Breadcrumb on top of the page: have the name "Settings" + Save / discard CTA + Search
- Add General Settings on the nav bar
- remove "save this page..." notif in all settings
- Delete all recommanded apps section + all checkbox that install app should disappear:
