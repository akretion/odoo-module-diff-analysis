[REF] mass_mailing: rename mail.mass_mailing model

PURPOSE

Mass mailing is currently a bit messy. As SMS will be added as a way to notify
people in mass through SMS let us take this opportunity to somehow clean this
application: organization, light code cleaning, model renaming.

SPECIFICATIONS

Rename mail.mass_mailing model to mailing.mailing. Rationale :

  * mailing is now a prefix for mass mailing models;
  * mailing.mailing is easier to read / find / understand;

Note that mail.mass_mailing.campaign is not updated as it is likely to be
removed soon and replaced by simple utm.campaign model.

MIGRATION

mail.mass_mailing model -> mailing.mailing
mail_mass_mailing table -> mailing_mailing
