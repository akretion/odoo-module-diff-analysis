[IMP] base_*, account_*,*: remove irrelevant elements based on country group

* = l10n_*.

This commit enhances clarity for users by removing settings and features that
are irrelevant to their region. Currently, certain elements specific to the EU
or SEPA are displayed globally, which can confuse users in other regions where
these features do not apply. By hiding these irrelevant elements, the interface
becomes more streamlined, improving usability and aligning the modules more
closely with user expectations.

To achieve this, a new field, 'code' has been introduced in the
res.country.group model. Two new helper functions have been introduced in the
res.country model. The first function determines whether a country belongs to a
specific country group based on its code field and has been utilized to enhance
the logic in the codebase by replacing direct references to country groups. The
second function retrieves all country_group_codes associated with a given
country.

Additionally, three auto-installed modules,
'module_account_bank_statement_import_ofx',
'module_account_bank_statement_import_csv',
and 'module_account_bank_statement_import_camt' have been removed from settings
to avoid unnecessary clutter.
