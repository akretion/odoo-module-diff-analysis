[MOV] mail, im_livechat: split models related to mail channel and reorder some fields definitions

RATIONALE

Channel model is a mail.thread enabled model behaving strangely with followers,
notifications and discuss. Its code should however be simplified to be more
self contained and avoid unwanted side effects on other models.

SPECIFICATIONS

Purpose is to prepare modifications in models by doing a preparatory cleaning
of some fields and model definitions. Notably

  * move mail.channel.partner im_livechat override in its own file;
  * slightly re-order member-related fields on channel or mail.channel.partner
    models, and split long lines;

This commit should not change anything functionally as it contains is only some
code move and reordering.
