[REV] *: Restore the model `_name`

Following internal discussions, the python typing and inheritance task is
canceled. The use of the class name instead of '_name' was done to allow
notations such as `partner_id = fields.Many2one[base.ResParter](string='Partner')`.
Since this notation is canceled, we put `_name` back (although the class
name is sufficient).
