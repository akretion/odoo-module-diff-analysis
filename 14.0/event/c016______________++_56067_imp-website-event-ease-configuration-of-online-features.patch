[IMP] (website_)event: ease configuration of Online features

PURPOSE

Clean organization and models linked to Event Online feature introduced in
semi stable saas-13.3 at odoo/odoo@981f95b and odoo/enterprise@1472202

Also clean website event menu not being available in website event but only
in website event track, which implies some extra-code to manage it.

In short: merge website_event_online in website_event, website_event_track
_(online/session) in website_event_track.

RATIONALE

_online modules have been added to extend content of website_event and
website_event_track without having any impact on those module. First step
of cleaning is to move this content directly in base module.

track_session module is mainly a rewrite of track module. Second step of
cleaning is to move its content directly in website_event_track.

SPECIFICATIONS

Allow to configure Menu CTA button on event from event_type, like other
frontend related menus and buttons.

Add settings to ease discovering and installing sub event features like
  * meet;
  * exhibitor;
  * live mode;
  * quizzes;
